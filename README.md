# Navio
Navio is a collection of Navigation Bars made using HTML/CSS and a tiny bit of JavaScript


All designs are organized in separate folders , each design has a Html and a Css file defining the design , in case you want to configure 
the color scheme or font sizes , font family and the transition periods , please check SchemeConfiguration.css , this Css file is mandatory and is linked to all designs , make sure to add it when you try one of the designs , if you want to customize and alter the color theme , you can do all of that through the Scheme Configuration file , so always ensure it's there with the design files you choose.


I left comments mostly everywhere so it becomes easier for you to discern each part from the other

Have Fun !
